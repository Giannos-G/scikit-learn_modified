# scikit-learn_modified
This is the repo of a modified version of scikit-learn which is used to benchmark every example and benchmark included in the original repo. I commented all of the *plt.show()* commands to every script of */examples* and */benchmarks* in order to minimize human intreaction with each script so that my energy, time and memory benchmarking will be more accurate. That's all the changes I made :)
